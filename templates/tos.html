When sufficient funds have been deposited to (1) satisfy all Fees (as defined below) owed to Glass for the Service and (2) pay the entire amount of costs, shipping, and taxes (the “Total Cost”) required to purchase the Underlying Good (“Sufficient Funds”), Glass will remit the Fee to Glass and remit Total Costs to the Merchant.
